<h2> Katherine's Feed </h2>

<p> It was late at night. I had managed to sneak out of my house via my window. I was sneaking out to meet up with my friend Nathan. Nathan meet me outside my house and we started our adventure. We walked all the way to the other side of town to McKinley lake. We walked all the way around it until reaching a dock where Isaiah and my good friend Keith were. They were on Isaiah's bike. Nathan and I didn't want to walk all the way back around the lake so they offered to give us a ride across the lake. NAthan and I hopped on Isaiah's bike behind Keith. We started to peddle into the water. I was worried about my phone getting wet so I held my arm up the whole time so it wouldn't. After getting too the other side of the lake we had to climb up on the bank because there was no dock. I checked my phone for water damage while I was standing in the water, threw it on the bank, and climbed out not wet at all. Nathan, Keith, and Isaiah were all soaking wet. After that, I woke up. </p>
